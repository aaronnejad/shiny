Create macroeconomic maps with information from the 2010 US Eco figures.
This applicatiion allows us to monitor the percentage on the national curve each county ranks in terms of 
the chosen economic statistic. For example if we narrow the slider below to only include 50-60th percentile for the 
chosen economic measure. It will only highlight on the map counties that have that range. Example 0% indicates that it 
is on the bottom of the curve and 100% indicates that it is the wealthiest.
